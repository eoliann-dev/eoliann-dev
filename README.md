## Hello world, Eoliann here :wave:
_Extreme weather events have increased by 345% in the last 50 years because of urbanization and climate change, decreasing the effectiveness of traditional risk management techniques._

We are a team of dreamers with a simple goal: make predictable the unpredictable. Through satellite data and ML algorithms we aim to improve the ability to forecast probability and impact of climate risks.
